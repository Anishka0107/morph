Use startSSL to generate a certificate.

Common name:
  dev.morph.io
Alternate names:
  api.dev.morph.io

Grab the nginx version of the certificate and put it in ssl-unified.crt
Copy across the private key to ssl.key.secure (you probably generated this
key using openssl as part of making the CSR)

Make sure when generating the CSR that you don't use a passphrase

Use the following openssl command to generate a private key and CSR without a passphrase:
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout yourname.key -out yourname.csr -nodes
