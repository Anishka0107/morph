Unlock real data from websites like [fire incidents in the Czech Republic](https://morph.io/soit-sk/firebrno), [upcoming legislation in the Chilean parliament](https://morph.io/ciudadanointeligente/pmocl-agendas), [postcodes in Slovakia](https://morph.io/soit-sk/slovakia_post_codes) and [buildings which are planned to be built or knocked down in Australia](https://morph.io/planningalerts-scrapers).

At the OpenAustralia Foundation, our civic tech projects rely on information we can only get by scraping. We've been writing scrapers for years and know, like you do, just how time consuming building and maintaining scrapers can be.

So we made morph.io to look after those scrapers for us and enable collaboration in the open. It's the culmination of everything we've learned.

We're excited to share morph.io with you and can't wait to see what you will do with it!
