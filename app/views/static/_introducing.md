Unlock real data from websites like [fire incidents in the Czech Republic](https://morph.io/soit-sk/firebrno), [upcoming legislation in the Chilean parliament](https://morph.io/ciudadanointeligente/pmocl-agendas), [postcodes in Slovakia](https://morph.io/soit-sk/slovakia_post_codes) and [buildings which are planned to be built or knocked down in Australia](https://morph.io/planningalerts-scrapers).

At the OpenAustralia Foundation, most of our civic tech projects also rely on information we can only get by scraping it, like when we need  [MP’s contact details] (https://morph.io/openaustralia/aus_mp_contact_details) for openaustralia.org. Building and maintaining scrapers got the data we needed but the process was time consuming.

So we made morph.io to look after those scrapers for us. Morph.io looks after all the little things that you don't anticipate that often take the most time.

Very quickly we realised we’d made something which could scale to help others who are liberating their own data!
