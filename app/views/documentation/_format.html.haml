%p
  Have your scraper create a SQLite database in the current working directory called
  <code>#{Morph::Database.sqlite_db_filename}</code>.
  How your scraper does that and what tables or fields you include is entirely up to you.
  If there's a table called <code>#{Morph::Database.sqlite_table_name}</code>
  then we'll show that on your scraper page first.

%p Here's how you can do this in your programming language:

= render "language_tabs", id_prefix: "storing_data", path: "documentation/storing_data"
