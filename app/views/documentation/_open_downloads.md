On each scraper you can see who has downloaded or used the API to get the data.
Your downloads are also listed there.

By being able to see openly who is using what, we aim to promote collaboration and serendipity.
Creating or scraping data is important, but it's people using it that really makes it exciting. Showing who downloads what, connects people making scrapers with those who use the data.

There may be situations where you don't want to be identified as downloading some data. In that case please create an alternate GitHub (and morph.io) account which does not identify you and use that to download the data.

If that's not possible, or you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au).
