You can see the list of people who have downloaded the data
collected by a scraper on morph.io.
Your downloads will be listed.
Use this information to find new people to collaborate with
and more open data to use in your own projects.

Downloads of .csv and database files, as well as calls to
scraper APIs are counted as ‘Downloads’.

If it is important for you to protect your identity
in downloading data from morph.io, you have a couple of options.
You could make an alternate Github account and email
for your work on morph.io, that cannot be linked back to the
identity you would like to protect.

If this is not possible, please contact us.
We'll do our best to help if you explain you're circumstances.
Morph is the scraping platform for civic hackers,
activists and researchers. We strongly believe in being open
by default, but understand there are times when data collection
must be protected.
