## What's New
Here we show you the changes that you can see. We update this page every few weeks.
There's also lots of stuff that changes under the
hood. If you're interested in seeing those too, look at the

## Summary for May & April 2015
It's been a busy few weeks as we're working hard to further improve the user experience by tweaking lots of small things and adding a few much-needed features.

The buildpacks support, that allows anybody to install their own libraries, is also now activated for everyone.

### April 30
Everyone can now easily install their own libraries and set their language versions. Up till now
this has only been available through the "experimental Buildpack support".

Unless you set your own libraries you should notice no difference to how your scrapers runs except
a small change to the console output.

### April 28
* In lists of scrapers show the language of the scraper
* Simplify the compile output of buildpacks
