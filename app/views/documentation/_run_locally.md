There are two different ways you can run scrapers locally while you're writing
them.

Either you can use the morph command-line client or you can install the
development tools for your language of choice on your machine.

See the page
["Running scrapers on your own machine"](<%= run_locally_documentation_index_path %>)
for details on how to do this.
