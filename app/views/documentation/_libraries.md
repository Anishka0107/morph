With morph.io it's easy to install the libraries you want to use and pick the version of the language too.

You specify what you want in your scraper repository.

Each language does this differently (using the
native tools to that language). So refer to the more detailed language documentation below for
your preferred language or use the documentation menu over to the left of the screen.

* [Installing libraries with Ruby](/documentation/ruby)
* [Installing libraries with PHP](/documentation/php)
* [Installing libraries with Python](/documentation/python)
* [Installing libraries with Perl](/documentation/perl)

If you don't specify any libraries or a language version it will default to using a setup
as close as possible to that of [ScraperWiki Classic](https://classic.scraperwiki.com/) as of January 2014. This is for the benefit of those that have forked their scrapers from ScraperWiki Classic.
