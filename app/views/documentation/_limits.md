Right now there are none. We are trusting you that you won't abuse this. Note that we are keeping track of the amount of cpu time (and a whole
bunch of other metrics) that you and your scrapers are using. So, if we do find that you are using too much (and no we don't know what that
is right now) we reserve the right to kick you out. In reality first we'll ask you nicely to stop.

We're thinking about putting limits in place on free accounts as this service grows. Also, potentially adding support for private scrapers
under a paid plan as well. Let us know [what you think and want](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au).
