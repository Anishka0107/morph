If your scraper needs libraries other than those listed above, right now you have to either [ask us to do it for you](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au) or make a pull request against one of the
morph-docker repositories which build the docker images.

This is a lot easier if you use the [new experimental Buildpack support](/documentation/buildpacks).
You can choose the version of the language you want to use as well as install your own libraries as
part of the scraper run.
