  The [Splinter](http://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest) library provides a higher-level
  wrapper for the [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py)
  frameworks.

  To install it, add `splinter` to your requirements.txt:
:coderay
  #!python
  splinter>=0.7.3

:markdown
  Then in your scraper,
:coderay
  #!python
  from splinter import Browser

  with Browser("phantomjs") as browser:
      # Optional, but make sure large enough that responsive pages don't
      # hide elements on you...
      browser.driver.set_window_size(1280, 1024)

      # Open the page you want...
      browser.visit("https://morph.io")

      # submit the search form...
      browser.fill("q", "parliament")
      button = browser.find_by_css("button[type='submit']")
      button.click()

      # Scrape the data you like...
      links = browser.find_by_css(".search-results .list-group-item")
      for link in links:
          print link['href']

  #### Testing locally
  As mentioned above, morph.io already has PhantomJS supplied as part of the default build process.

  To test this on your own machine, you'll first need to 
  [install PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) before
  the Splinter library will be able to use it. 
  
  Then you'll be able to [follow the remaining steps](/documentation/run_locally#run_locally-python) 
  to run your scraper locally.
