        %h3 Is this tax deductible?
        %p
          If you are an Australian resident and you are supporting at the "..." or
          "..." level your regular donation is tax-deductible.
        %h3 I don't see a supporter level that fits my budget
        %p
          These are our standard prices, but we're more than happy to figure out
          something that's right for you. Feel free to
          = mail_to 'contact@oaf.org.au', 'drop us a line'
          and tell us
          what you're looking for.
        %p
